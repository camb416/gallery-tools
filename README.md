An openframeworks addon that makes it easier to interactively load save and edit arbitrary quads for the purpose of warping 2D camera images.

## ofxCurve
Class that wraps openFrameworks bezier curve functionality. Handy for storing data about bezier curves for animation.

## ofxSkinnedCurve
This class helps draw bezier curves, but with raster images mapped onto them. It's very helpful in creating more natural-looking procedural limb movement in 2D.
